# Project Overview 
The purpose of this project is to:
- Design a simple database system from scratch using SQL.
- Create a use-case scenario from a business prespective.
- Populate and query the database to answer business questions.
- Visualize the data using **Power BI** providing insights into student enrollment, course popularity, and academic performance.

# Business Requirements
Your manager provides the following brief:

"We need a basic backend system to track which students are taking which courses, how many credits each course has, and what grades students are earning. Later on, we might want to generate reports on average grades, course popularity, and student performance. For now, we just need a solid foundation to start pulling reports from next week."
